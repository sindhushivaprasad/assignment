      <p>The venue is a cosy room on the first floor of the Victorian-era pub Rutland Arms, and the occasion is to drink beer and indulge in merrymaking.  </p>

      <p>While that does sound like a regular pub atmosphere, this one is quite a bit different- it's a room full of women, drinking weird beer and breaking stereotypes, all at the same time. </p>

      <p>To take the proverbial bull by the horns and shatter ‘beer is for men’ stereotypes, Liverpool-based organisation Ladies That Beer set base at the Sheffield pub and hosted an all-woman beer tasting event as part of the city's Beer Week.
</p>

      <p>This year, the week-long festival to celebrate the region’s brewing landscape was themed around women in the beer industry- from servers, to pub managers, to brewers and owners, the fest celebrated the diversity of the beer scene and how it is “better for it.”

      <p>
        Fiona Hood, a member of Ladies That Beer said: “We want to celebrate the talented women who work in the beer industry in all capacities; encourage more women to consider it as a career option and most importantly to get as many people as possible to try this thing that we love so much.”
      </p>
      <p> And “try this thing” they did- amidst general laughter and merriment, the women at the bottle-share tasted four “quirky” beers made by breweries in different parts of the world, including Texas and Germany.

      </p>

      <p>
        Over a pint of Russian Imperial stout with 12% alcohol aptly labelled “Death”, Ms Hood said events like the bottle share help women build confidence.
 </p>
      <p>She said: “It’s just that way of being free to- in a relaxed casual way with no concerns about if you’re going to be quizzed or held up to very high standards- discuss things, talk about your ideas, your thoughts about beer.

        “The main motivation behind this thing is also that we enjoy it… it’s not that we’re feel picked upon every day of our lives but there is a bias.”

      </p>

      <p>
        The bottle share event rounded up some of the UK brewing industry’s top female honchos like Leanne Rowe of Grain Brewery and FemAle, an organisation that promotes beer brewed by women.

      <p>
      Speaking of the ham-fisted approach to gender in the industry, Ladies That Beer founder Julie O’ Grady said: “While lots of us have been drinking and enjoying beer for many years we know that some women have traditionally been put off beer and pubs by stereotypes, attitudes and male-directed marketing.
      </p>

      <p>
“Some of the main stereotypes we'd like to address are that beer and pubs are for men, that only certain types/strengths/sizes of beer are suitable for women, and also that you don’t need a sexualised image of a woman or name on the beer label in order to sell it.”
      </p>
      <p>She said bars and pubs are more than pleased to host female punters, and added women were “just as varied in their tastes as men and just as knowledgeable.”
</p>
<p>About sexist marketing of beer, she said: “Men are perfectly able to judge your product by its taste, and if you deride and alienate at least half of the population before you've started, you're not a very good businessperson!

      <p>
        Through Ladies That Beer, the founders and members wanted to make beer and the brewing industry as inclusive as possible to people of all genders, not in the least women.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ms O’ Grady said: “We love beer and since there are so many styles, with a huge range of flavours, we firmly believe there is a beer out there for everyone.
      </p>
      <p> "The other element of getting more women into beer is encouraging the industry to be more welcoming to them. We challenge sexist marketing and behaviour on social media and take part in discussions and panel debates on sexism and inclusivity in the beer industry.
<p>
        "We really want women (and everyone) to feel comfortable walking into a bar or beer festival and trying or enjoying a beer."</p>
